## ZeaZ Platform & apps/* Monorepo Rules
When implementing tasks on the `zeaz-platform` repository, you MUST strictly enforce these architecture and workflow rules:
1. **Monorepo Architecture (apps/*)**: The platform is a unified monorepo. ALL applications, microservices, frontends, and AI toolings (e.g., zLinebot, zwallet, zdash) reside inside the `apps/` directory. Do not create top-level directories for apps. When refactoring or adding features, always scope your work to the specific `apps/<app-name>/` folder.
2. **Environment Variables**: Avoid scattering `.env` files. Consolidate environment variables into a central `.env.example` inside the respective app folder. Canonical Cloudflare variables (e.g. `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`, `CLOUDFLARE_ZONE_ID`) MUST be used instead of legacy `CF_` variants.
3. **Commit Workflow**: NEVER use `git commit` or `git push` directly. ALWAYS stage your intended files with `git add` and commit using `make gpg-finalize COMMIT_MSG="..."` from the repository root to ensure all GitOps and DevSecOps checks pass.
4. **Security**: NEVER commit or generate real secrets. Unsafe placeholders like `replace-me`, `changeme`, `dummy-secret` are FORBIDDEN.
5. **Language**: Code, documentation, and technical definitions MUST be in English.

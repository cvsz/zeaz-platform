The GitHub CLI does not yet support creating discussions (`gh discussion create` is unavailable).

Please create the welcome discussion manually (one-time action):

1. Go to: https://github.com/CVSz/zLinebot/discussions
2. Click "New discussion"
3. Select category: 📢 Announcements
4. Use the following title and body:

Title:
🚀 Welcome to zLinebot Discussions – Production Configuration Active

Body:
### zLinebot Discussions – Production Configuration Complete

The repository now uses a structured discussion system tailored to multi-tenant commerce, LINE messaging, conversational AI, privacy/compliance, and infrastructure workflows.

**Guidelines**
- Follow [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](../CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md).

This setup is managed by `scripts/configure_discussions.sh` (version ${SCRIPT_VERSION}).

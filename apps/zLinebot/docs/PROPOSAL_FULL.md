# ZLineBot Full Proposal

Last updated: 2026-04-02

## Executive summary

ZLineBot proposes a unified, multi-tenant commerce and conversational automation platform for teams selling through LINE and adjacent social channels. The platform consolidates catalog, cart, ordering, billing, privacy/compliance, and intelligent decisioning into one extensible control plane.

## Problem statement

Teams operating commerce over chat/social channels often face:

- Fragmented systems (chat, catalog, fulfillment, billing, analytics in separate tools)
- Weak tenant isolation for multi-brand/multi-store operations
- Limited governance (auditability, privacy workflows, policy enforcement)
- Slow experimentation lifecycle for recommendation/pricing/routing policies

## Proposed solution

Deploy ZLineBot as a modular platform with:

1. **Tenant-aware API gateway and service layer**
2. **Operational admin UI** for billing/order/health workflows
3. **Integration adapters** (LINE, TikTok, payment/webhook surfaces)
4. **Data and event backbone** for observability and ML loops
5. **Compliance layer** for consent/DSR/evidence generation
6. **AI/ML extension layer** for ranking, policy optimization, and automation

## Scope and deliverables

### In-scope (Phase 1)
- Product/cart/order APIs
- Tenant auth headers and routing controls
- LINE webhook integration and secure signature verification
- Admin dashboard + billing/admin endpoints
- Baseline audit and privacy endpoints
- Docker-first deployment and basic k8s manifests

### In-scope (Phase 2)
- TikTok auth/webhooks and shop panel operations
- Event ingestion and richer metrics
- Feature-store integration paths and Flink jobs
- Advanced policy controls, risk guardrails, and failover paths

### In-scope (Phase 3)
- Recommendation/ranking lifecycle hardening
- RLHF/causal/bandit experimentation program
- Cost/performance optimizations and region strategies

### Out-of-scope (initial)
- Guaranteed real-time ETL SLAs across every external source
- Turnkey enterprise IAM provisioning for all identity providers
- Turnkey SOC2/ISO certification package

## Target users

- **Operations teams:** need reliable order/billing/admin workflows
- **Growth teams:** need experimentation tools and channel integrations
- **Compliance/security teams:** need auditable privacy and control surfaces
- **Engineering/platform teams:** need a composable backend with clear deployment options

## Business outcomes and KPIs

Primary KPIs:

- Conversion uplift on recommendation-enabled flows
- Reduction in order processing latency
- Reduction in integration incident MTTR
- Privacy request SLA compliance (DSR turnaround)
- Tenant onboarding lead time

Secondary KPIs:

- Infrastructure cost per 1,000 orders
- API error rate (4xx/5xx by domain)
- Webhook reliability and replay success

## Technical design principles

- **Tenant-first security boundaries** on data and routes
- **Modularity** for domain services and integrations
- **Operational transparency** with metrics, logs, and audit trails
- **Progressive hardening** from local/dev to production-grade topologies
- **Docs-as-product** with bilingual and role-based manuals

## Risks and mitigations

- **Complexity creep:** mitigate via phased releases and strict scope gates
- **Integration fragility:** mitigate with retry, signature verification, DLQ strategy
- **Compliance gaps:** mitigate with standardized privacy workflows and evidence outputs
- **Model drift / policy regressions:** mitigate with offline+online evaluation loops

## Rollout plan

### Milestone A (0-4 weeks)
- Baseline deployability and tenant API flows
- Health checks, basic dashboards, and install playbook

### Milestone B (4-8 weeks)
- Integration robustness (LINE/TikTok/payment)
- Admin workflows maturity and audit export capabilities

### Milestone C (8-12 weeks)
- Experimentation frameworks and feature pipelines
- Governance hardening, DR/failover test cycles

## Resourcing model

Recommended core squad:

- 1 Tech lead / platform architect
- 2-3 backend engineers
- 1 frontend engineer
- 1 devops/SRE engineer
- 1 QA/automation engineer
- Shared compliance/security advisor

## Acceptance criteria

A release is accepted when:

- Core APIs pass health and smoke tests
- Tenant isolation and auth checks are enforced
- Admin critical paths are usable end-to-end
- Install runbooks are validated on clean host(s)
- Privacy endpoints and audit exports produce expected artifacts

## Documentation commitments

The project maintains:

- Full install manual
- Role-based user/admin guides
- Architecture/repo structure references
- Proposal/roadmap artifacts with versioned updates

## Decision request

Proceed with phased implementation starting from Milestone A, with bi-weekly governance review and KPI check-ins to control scope, security posture, and operational quality.

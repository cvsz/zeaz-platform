## 🛠️ Local Development

Ready to iterate locally? Setup is straightforward.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v18 or higher)
- A local PostgreSQL instance or a free cloud Database URL.

### Setup

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/SamurAIGPT/mail-wise
cd mail-wise

# 2. Install dependencies
npm install

# 3. Setup Environment
cp .env.example .env
# Open .env and insert your specific keys. You can use a local DB or your dev cloud DB.

# 4. Initialize Database Schema
npx prisma generate
npx prisma db push

# 5. Start the Development Server
npm run dev
```

The graphical console should now be heavily responsive on `http://localhost:3000`.

## 🗄️ Database Setup (Prisma Introspection Cycle)

> ⚠️ **Database Safety Warning**: This application shares a single PostgreSQL database instance on Supabase with other applications in this workspace. Follow the cycle below to synchronize models safely:
>
> 1. **Pull all existing tables**: `npx prisma db pull` (introspects all active tables)
> 2. **Declare relation changes**: Inject the `EmailCreation` model in your local `schema.prisma` and link it inside the `User` model.
> 3. **Push to database**: Run `npx prisma db push` to merge changes safely.
> 4. **Local Schema Cleanup**: Strip away other applications' models from your local `schema.prisma`, leaving only `Account`, `Session`, `User`, `VerificationToken`, and `EmailCreation`.
> 5. **Compile local client**: Run `npx prisma generate` to build your local Prisma client.

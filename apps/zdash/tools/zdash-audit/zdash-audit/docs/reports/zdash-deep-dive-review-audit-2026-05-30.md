# zDash Deep Dive Review + Audit Report

Generated: `2026-05-30T13:03:42+00:00`  
Repository: `cvsz/zdash`  
Audit type: static architecture, safety, security, frontend/backend, CI, release-readiness, and deep-source-scan plan

---

## 1. Executive Summary

`cvsz/zdash` is positioned as a safety-first AI operations dashboard and agent runtime for staged automation, trading simulation, governance, observability, and enterprise control workflows.

Current assessment:

```text
Architecture direction:       Strong
Safety-by-default posture:    Strong
Frontend dashboard scope:     Broad and coherent
Backend/API scope:            Broad, needs enforced gates and proof
Security posture:             Good documentation baseline, needs automated evidence
Release readiness:            HOLD until local validation output is captured
Production readiness:         HOLD until fail-closed production config tests pass
```

Final decision:

```text
RELEASE DECISION: HOLD FOR VALIDATION
```

Reason:

```text
This audit reviewed public repo documentation and generated a full local deep-scan plan, but did not execute repo tests, builds, Docker validation, secret scans, or runtime smoke tests inside the actual repo checkout.
```

---

## 2. Source Facts Used

Observed public repo facts:

```text
Repository: cvsz/zdash
Purpose: safety-first AI operations dashboard and agent runtime
Backend: FastAPI on 0.0.0.0:8005
Frontend: React/Vite on 0.0.0.0:5173
Node: Node 20 LTS via nvm
Python: Python 3.11+ / 3.12 tested
Trading: simulation/dry-run only by default
IoT: dry-run + confirmation-gated by default
Social posting: dry-run + approval-gated by default

```

---

## 3. Repository Role and Ownership

### zDash owns

```text
application code
local config defaults
backend implementation
frontend implementation
tests
docs
phase prompts
dashboard UI
agent runtime
safety-first behavior
```

### zeaz-platform owns

```text
Cloudflare DNS
Pages/Tunnel routing
Access
WAF
API Shield
edge health checks
production support-domain rollout
```

Audit recommendation:

```text
Do not move Cloudflare mutation logic directly into zDash.
Use zDash as app source of truth and zeaz-platform as edge/infrastructure source of truth.
```

---

## 4. Runtime and Developer Workflow Review

Expected runtime:

```text
Backend:
  cd ~/zdash/backend
  source .venv/bin/activate
  uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8005 --reload

Frontend:
  source ~/.nvm/nvm.sh
  nvm use 20
  cd ~/zdash/frontend
  npm run dev -- --host 0.0.0.0 --port 5173
```

Health checks:

```text
http://localhost:8005/health
http://localhost:8005/api
http://localhost:5173
```

Audit findings:

| Severity | Finding | Recommendation |
|---|---|---|
| P1 | Backend and frontend ports are fixed and documented | Preserve `8005` and `5173` in scripts/tests |
| P1 | Node uses nvm, not apt npm | Add installer guard preventing apt npm usage |
| P1 | Mock fallback is core UX behavior | Test degraded/offline UI explicitly |
| P2 | VM URL examples are environment-specific | Keep local and VM URLs clearly separate |

---

## 5. Safety Audit

Documented high-risk capabilities:

```text
trading
automation
IoT
social posting
update workflows
support bundles
fleet operations
marketplace/plugin concepts
security operations
```

Required safety defaults:

```text
live trading: disabled
real broker order execution: disabled
real IoT power actions: disabled
real social posting: disabled
secret export: disabled
real infrastructure mutation: disabled
real update apply/rollback: disabled
raw shell relay: disabled
unreviewed plugin execution: disabled
destructive automation: disabled
```

Required non-bypass gates:

```text
Guardian risk checks
drawdown guard
kill switch / halt flag
content approval
RBAC
tenant isolation
audit logging
policy/certification/attestation gates
backup/readiness checks before mutation
```

### Safety findings

#### P0-SAFETY-001 — Production fail-closed validator required

Risk:

```text
A production deployment could accidentally enable unsafe flags through environment variables.
```

Required tests:

```text
test_production_requires_auth_enabled
test_production_rejects_default_jwt_secret
test_production_rejects_live_trading_without_gate
test_production_rejects_iot_real_actions_without_confirmation_policy
test_production_rejects_social_auto_post_without_approval_policy
test_support_bundle_excludes_secrets_by_default
```

#### P0-SAFETY-002 — High-risk action policy must be centralized

All high-risk action paths should pass through one policy gate:

```text
auth -> RBAC -> tenant scope -> safety policy -> typed confirmation -> audit event -> adapter
```

High-risk classes:

```text
trading_order
iot_power
social_publish
infra_mutation
update_apply
rollback_execute
plugin_execute
support_bundle_export
secret_export
raw_shell
```

#### P1-SAFETY-003 — UI safety state must be impossible to miss

Required UI states:

```text
DRY_RUN ACTIVE
Guardian enabled
Kill switch / halt state
Risk approval required
Social dry-run
IoT dry-run
Provider safe mode
Simulated mode banner
```

## 6. Frontend Audit

Documented frontend architecture:

```text
layout components:
  frontend/src/components/layout/
  Sidebar
  Topbar
  PageHeader

pages:
  Dashboard
  Team Roster
  Trading
  Risk
  Scheduler
  Backtests
  Content
  IoT
  Org Map
  Logs
  Settings

API:
  frontend/src/api/client.ts
  frontend/src/api/endpoints.ts
  frontend/src/api/mockData.ts
```

Environment defaults:

```text
VITE_APP_NAME=zDash
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8005
VITE_ENABLE_MOCK_FALLBACK=true
VITE_POLL_INTERVAL_MS=5000
VITE_DEFAULT_THEME=dark
VITE_SHOW_SAFETY_BANNERS=true
```

### Frontend findings

| Severity | Finding | Action |
|---|---|---|
| P1 | Mock fallback can hide backend outages | Show clear simulated/degraded mode banner |
| P1 | High-risk UI needs disabled states | Add tests for disabled buttons and confirmations |
| P1 | `VITE_*` variables are browser-exposed | Add denylist test for secret-like frontend env vars |
| P2 | Many dashboard pages increase regression surface | Add smoke render test per route |
| P2 | Safety banners rely on env flag | Ensure production cannot hide safety banners on high-risk pages |

Required tests:

```text
dashboard_renders
all_routes_render
safety_banner_visible
dry_run_badge_visible
mock_fallback_banner_visible
high_risk_actions_disabled_by_default
typed_confirmation_required_for_real_mode

```

### Backend findings

| Severity | Finding | Action |
|---|---|---|
| P0 | High-risk routes require enforceable policy | Add central policy dependency/middleware |
| P0 | Production config must fail closed | Add startup validator + tests |
| P1 | Provider adapters must fail safely | Add contract test matrix |
| P1 | Audit logs must be append-only for real actions | Add audit schema tests |
| P2 | Health should separate live/ready/dependency status | Add `/health/live`, `/health/ready`, `/health/dependencies` if absent |

Required backend tests:

```text
test_health_endpoint
test_api_envelope_shape
test_auth_required_for_admin_routes
